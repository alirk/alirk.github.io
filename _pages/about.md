I am an Associate Professor (with tenure) in the [Department of Informatics](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/index.html) at the [University of Oslo (UiO)](https://www.uio.no/english/), a Research Theme Leader at the [Norwegian Center for Knowledge-driven Machine Learning (Integreat)](https://www.integreat.no/), a Principal Investigator at TRUST – The Norwegian Centre for Trustworthy AI, a Senior Researcher at [MishMash Centre for AI and Creativity](https://mishmash.no/), and a member of the [European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS) Society](https://ellis.eu/). I serve as an Area Chair of NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, and AISTATS and Action Editor for [Transactions on Machine Learning Research](https://jmlr.org/tmlr/index.html). I have received [FRIPRO Grant for Early Career Scientists](https://www.integreat.no/news/two-new-integreat-pis-awarded-fripro-grants-ingrid.html) and Top 10% Area Chair Recognition at NeurIPS 2025. 

Before joining UiO, I was a Senior Scientific Collaborator at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), working with [Prof. Volkan Cevher](https://people.epfl.ch/volkan.cevher?lang=en) in [Laboratory for Information and Inference Systems (LIONS)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lions/). Before joining LIONS, I was an [NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pd-np/pdf-bp_eng.asp) at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) in Toronto working with [Prof. Daniel M. Roy](http://danroy.org/). I received my Ph.D. from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) where I was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ben Liang](https://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~liang/) and [Prof. Min Dong](https://sites.google.com/ontariotechu.net/dong?pli=1). 

My current research is focused on **understanding how the input data distribution is encoded within layers of neural networks** and developing **theoretical concepts** and **practical tools** to minimize the statistical risk under resource constraints and realistic settings referring to **statistical and system** characteristics contrary to an ideal learning setting. My current research topics: **Trustworthy AI**, **Deep Learning**, **Learning Theory**, **LLMs and Reasoning Models**, and **Emotion Recognition** and **Co-creative AI**.

<img style="float: left;" src="/images/LayerQuant.png" width="320"/> We have developed a general **layer-wise quantization** framework taking into account the statistical heterogeneity across layers and an efficient solver for distributed variational inequalities. We establish tight variance and code-length bounds for layer-wise quantization, which generalize the bounds for global quantization frameworks.  We empirically achieve up to a **150% speedup** over the baselines in end-to-end training time for training Wasserstein GAN on **12+ GPUs**.

<img style="float: left;" src="/images/LS.png" width="320"/>  We have introduced a method to **minimize overall true risk** in distributed settings under inter-node and intra-node **label shifts**. We improve test-to-train density ratio estimation through Shannon entropy-based regularization. Our method encourages smoother and more reliable predictions that account for inherent uncertainty in the data with a better approximation of class conditional probabilities, and **achieves up to 20% improvement in average test error** in imbalanced settings approaching an upper bound.

<img style="float: left;" src="/images/SGDEM.png" width="320"/>  We have shown it is crucial to establish an appropriate balance between the **optimization error** associated with the empirical risk and the **generalization error** when accelerating SGD with momentum and established generalization error bounds and explicit convergence rates for SGD with momentum under a broad range of hyperparameters including a general step-size rule. For smooth Lipschitz loss functions, we analyze SGD with early momentum (SGDEM) under a broad range
of step-sizes, and show that it can train machine learning models for multiple epochs with a guarantee for generalization.

<img style="float: left;" src="/images/FIDEM2.png" width="320"/>  Even for a single client, the distribution shift between training and test data, i.e., intra-client distribution shift,has been a major challenge for decades. For instance, scarce disease data for training and test in a local hospital can be different. We focus on the **overall generalization** performance on multiple clients  and modify the classical ERM to obtain an unbiased estimate of an overall true risk minimizer under **intra-client and inter-client covariate shifts**, develop an efficient density ratio estimation method under stringent privacy requirements of federated learning, and show importance-weighted ERM achieves smaller generalization error than classical ERM.

<img style="float: left;" src="/images/FID_evolution.png" width="350"/>  Beyond supervised learning, we accelerate large-scale monotone variational inequality problems with applications such as training GANs in  distributed settings. We propose **quantized generalized extra-gradient (Q-GenX) family of algorithms** with the optimal rate of convergence and achieve noticeable speedups when training GANs on multiple GPUs without performance degradation.

<img style="float: left;" src="/images/MixTailor_Overview.png" width="350"/>   ML models are vulnerable to various attacks at training and test time including data/model poisoning and adversarial examples. We introduce MixTailor, a scheme based on randomization of the aggregation strategies that makes it impossible for the attacker to be fully informed.  **MixTailor: Mixed Gradient Aggregation for Robust Learning Against Tailored Attacks** increases computational complexity of designing tailored attacks for an informed adversary.

<img style="float: left;" src="/images/OPNN.png" width="300"/>   Overparameterization refers to the important phenomenon where the width of a neural network is chosen such that learning algorithms can provably attain zero loss in nonconvex training. In **Subquadratic Overparameterization for Shallow Neural Networks**, we achieve the best known bounds on the number of parameters that is sufficient for gradient descent to converge to a global minimum with linear rate and probability approaching to one.

<img style="float: left;" src="/images/Result50_bs256.png" width="350"/>   In training deep models over multiple GPUs, the communication time required to share huge stochastic gradients is the main performance bottleneck. We closed the gap between theory and practice of unbiased gradient compression. **NUQSGD** is currently the method offering the highest communication-compression while still converging under regular (uncompressed) hyperparameter values.

 
Ali Ramezani-Kebrya, Fartash Faghri, Ilya Markov, Vitalii Aksenov, Dan Alistarh, and Daniel M. Roy, **NUQSGD: Provably Communication-Efficient Data-Parallel SGD via Nonuniform Quantization**, Journal of Machine Learning Research, vol. 22, pp. 1-43, Apr. 2021.  
[pdf](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume22/20-255/20-255.pdf){: .btn--research} [bib](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v22/20-255.bib){: .btn--research} [code](https://github.com/fartashf/nuqsgd){: .btn--research} [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06077){: .btn--research} 


<img style="float: left;" src="/images/MultiGPU.png" width="350"/>   Communication-efficient variants of SGD are often heuristic and fixed over the course of training. In **Adaptive Gradient Quantization for Data-Parallel SGD**, we empirically observe that the statistics of gradients of deep models change during the training and introduce two adaptive quantization schemes. We improve the validation accuracy by almost 2% on CIFAR-10 and 1% on ImageNet in challenging low-cost communication setups.
